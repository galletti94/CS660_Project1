MESSAGE TO WENSI:
 
In general it is best to minimize the amount of redundancy in the code we write. This is why I deleted a lot of the html files you created. For example search_photos, search_friends, etc are all a subset of a larger thing that is search. we need only specify in our search function what we are searching for instead of writing three separate functions that do pretty much the same thing. I hope that makes sense. I kept the functions you made because it will be useful to have different function names :)
 
I re-organized a lot of things (mostly renaming the files so that is makes more sense conceptually what is being done). I also implemented different views for whether you are logged in or not and started the process of implementing the friend functionality. I will explain better tomorrow the user flow of the app but essentially by clicking on an image you see the uploader and can then be friends with them if you are logged in.
 
The plan for the next few days and the next week will be to upload a new and improved version of the database (one closer to the solution posted). Then we need to figure out how to display all the pictures of all the users in a nice way. Then we should implement things like friendship, likes, comments, etc. The last thing should be recommendation - this is very hard to do well but i will explain how it works and we can work on it together. Finally we need to make the site look a little nicer - maybe have a menu button instead of 5 navigation bar buttons, change the style and font and colors etc if we have time.
 
Try getting familiar with the new version of the code before we meet if you have time. Otherwise its ok i can walk you through it. See you tomorrow!
